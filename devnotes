  - Most of skeleton game logic written
  - The "initBibleKG" function takes a double pointer at this time
    not a big fan of this because it looks messy. May change later
  TODO: implement drawing functions with SDL

  - The crosshair used in the game can probably drawn using SDL's
    drawing functions so it's probably not necessary to use a
    spritesheet or anything like that. I kept the Crosshair struct
    in crosshair.h just in case but I'll be using Xhair (which is
    just int[5]) for the foreseeable future.
  TODO: Still need to implement the SDL drawing functions
